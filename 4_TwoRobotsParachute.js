// Problem - Geek for Geeks

// Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. 
// They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. 
// They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.


// I. moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time

// II. moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time

// III. noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time

// IV. onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false

// V. didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false



// Write a function in order to make the robots meet each other. Robots will be executing the same copy of this function.
